        <h2>10th Prime Minister of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</b> (25 December 1924 â€“ 16 August

          first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term
          from 1999 to 2004. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the BJP. He was a member of the
          RSS, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the INC to
          serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and a writer.
          <br><br>
          He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok
          Sabha, the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the MP (LS) for Lucknow,
          retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the BJS, of
          which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other parties to form the JP, which won
          the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of
          Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata alliance collapsed soon after. Former
          members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first president.
